Creating a Data Driven Website with React
CSC 260 Project 3 
 
You will create a portfolio level project to showcase 
your mastery of web development using React.

America 250 KY Boyle county committee is working to celebrate the history of the County.  They have created a datafile with information about important historical sites as well as images of the sites.  

Your job is to create a full website that will allow users to pursue and learn about the County.  While the present datafile only has 20 sites, there are plans to extend the datafile to include 1-2 hundred sites, which your design needs to address.

A top grade will show a mastery of React and incorporate the following:
Should display the present information found on the site.
Should be pleasant to look at and use.
Should utilize the data stored in the JSON file to show content
Should be a single page app that uses the React router
Incorporate a React Interactive component

Under the overarching guidance that your project should showcase your mastery of React, You will be given a large amount of freedom in the manner in which you complete your work.
To complete your project:
You may choose to make it optimized for mobile OR desktop. You will only be assessed on one.
You need to use the JSON file, however, you can alter, update, or expand the data present within it.
You can choose what is presented, where it is presented, and how it is presented.  You have complete control over the presentation of the material.

You can use any of the libraries and modules we used in class.  While it might be advantageous to incorporate additional libraries to meet the goals of enhancing the website experience, these approaches will be tempered against the opportunity to showcase a significant mastery of React. 

All requests to use external libraries must be delivered in writing at the beginning of class on Friday.  Requests should include why the library is necessary and how the use of the library will still require a significant amount of programming.   If a library makes the programming contribution trivial, it will be denied as a graded component of your project.  You are free to add it for your portfolio, but it will NOT be graded.


Daily Milestones (20% of grade)

Presented at the beginning of class each day. These are the bare minimums to complete the work by the end of the semester.  You should endeavor to complete milestones early.  Unless the entire project is complete, you are expected to be in class actively engaged on your work.


Thursday Jan 22 - Load from JSON file, print out how many records are stored in the file.

Friday Jan 23 -Prototype router in place that can print the name of each site on its own page.  Clean layout not required.
Deadline for React Interactive Proposals and additional library requests. 

Monday Jan 26 - (Cumulative test in morning, milestone presentation in afternoon)
Clean layout of all content. Prototypes of React Interactive elements presented

Tuesday Jan 27 - Presentation of Complete project at Centre Showcase from 10-11:30 (must setup 30 minutes before hand)


Beauty and Aesthetic (20% of grade)

Information and visuals are pleasing to view and design decisions all work to form into a cohesive site.

Data Driven Website (40% of grade)

Products should display the information in a way that is both easy to use, intuitive, and pleasing to interact with.  

React Interactive Component (20% of grade)

Each group will add an interactive component to the webpage.   This should allow the user to interact with the website in a novel way not already realized.  It should make use of the useState to deal with changing state or the useLocalStorage function to save info between sessions.  This is left vague so you have freedom to pick something you are excited about.  A short 1-2 paragraph proposal is required at the beginning of class on Friday.  If your team is unable to come up with one before Friday, the instructor will assign a React Interactive component to your group to implement.

Deliverables:
Submit a zip of your source files to moodle.  All projects will be presented at the Centre Showcase.  No work will be accepted after the showcase.
